  abstract={Data-driven artificial intelligence models fed with published scientific findings have been used to create powerful prediction engines for scientific and technological advance, such as the discovery of novel materials with desired properties and the targeted invention of new therapies and vaccines. These AI approaches typically ignore the distribution of human prediction engines -- scientists and inventor -- who continuously alter the landscape of discovery and invention. As a result, AI hypotheses are designed to substitute for human experts, failing to complement them for punctuated collective advance. Here we show that incorporating the distribution of human expertise into self-supervised models by training on inferences cognitively available to experts dramatically improves AI prediction of future human discoveries and inventions. Including expert-awareness into models that propose (a) valuable energy-relevant materials increases the precision of materials predictions by ~100%, (b) repurposing thousands of drugs to treat new diseases increases precision by 43%, and (c) COVID-19 vaccine candidates examined in clinical trials by 260%. These models succeed by predicting human predictions and the scientists who will make them. By tuning AI to avoid the crowd, however, it generates scientifically promising "alien" hypotheses unlikely to be imagined or pursued without intervention, not only accelerating but punctuating scientific advance. By identifying and correcting for collective human bias, these models also suggest opportunities to improve human prediction by reformulating science education for discovery.},

  title={Data on how science is made can make science better},
  abbr={HDSR},
  abstract={Science is an engine of innovation and economic growth and a pathway to prosperity for countries around the world. The increasing availability of scientific publications today poses a data-driven opportunity to better understand and improve science. Scientific publications contain data on the content of published research and metadata on the context that gave rise to that research. Here we discuss and demonstrate the power of constructing, archiving, and analyzing links between scientific data and metadata to construct massive computational observatories of and for modern science. We show how these can be constructed using modern graph databases, and suggest some methods of analysis with potential to unleash sustained value for science and society. These scientific observatories would allow us to diagnose the health of the scientific workforce and institutions, and track the rate of scientific advance. They could enable us to better guide science policy and build portfolios of supported research that balance our societal commitments to diverse participation and prosperity. Moreover, they could enable scientists to surf the deluge of published research to open the scientific frontier in directions that do not follow the current, but open up new views and opportunities for others to follow. Linked scientific data can also enable the construction of artificial intelligence agents designed to complement the disciplinary focus of human scientific attention by proposing possibilities overlooked or underfunded by contemporary scientific institutions. Finally, we argue for the importance of ongoing political and legal support for the promotion of open, linked data to facilitate widespread benefit.},

  author={Evans, James and Shi, Feng and Sourati, Jamshid},
  abstract={Embodiments disclosed herein receive a corpus of documents associated with a predictive hypothesis. The embodiments may generate a hypergraph comprising a plurality of nodes, the plurality of nodes including content nodes representing content elements from the documents and context nodes representing context elements of the documents, and hyperedges representing each document spanning two or more of the plurality of nodes. This hypergraph may be used to store a predictive hypothesis including a subset of the content elements, each content element of the subset of content elements having a vector representation meeting a predictive hypothesis threshold.},
