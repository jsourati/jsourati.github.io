[comment]: <> (I am a data scientist with interests in computational social science in general, and science of science in particular. I would like to develop data-driven tools that incoporate social aspects of science as well as contextual data for a better and more comprehensive view of science.)

I am a data scientist with a broad computational experience, from applying learning-based computer vision approaches in medical image processing to combining machine learning models with network tools in tackling computational social science problems. My main research interests revolve around machine-assisted knowledge discovery and analysis of knowledge evolution.

Since November 2019, I have been a post-doctoral scholar in [Knowledge Lab](https://www.knowledgelab.org/) at the Sociology Department of the University of Chicago. Before that, I had been a post-doctoral research fellow in [Computational Radiology Laboratory (CRL)](http://crl.med.harvard.edu) at Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School for two years (June 2017-October 2019). Going back even further, I was a Ph.D. student in [SPIRAL lab](https://web.northeastern.edu/spiral/) at Electrical and Computer Engineering Department of Northeastern University, Boston MA.
