I am a data scientist with interests in computational social science in general, and understanding science as a collective enterprise of humans in particular.

Since November 2019, I have been a Post-doctoral Scholar in Knowledge Lab at the Sociology Department of the University of Chicago. Before that, I had been a post-doctoral research fellow at Boston Childrens Hospital, Harvard Medical School for two years (June 2017-October 2019). And even before that, I was a Ph.D. student at Electrical and Computer Engineering Department of Northeastern University, Boston MA.
